Project for the Deep Learning course by Sol√®ne Blasco-Lopez and [Khaled Larbi](https://github.com/khaledlarbi)

This repository contains all the materials from our Deep Learning project.

# Presentation of our project !

:rocket: **Our mission** : Detect trashes on picture taken underwater. 

:microscope: **How ?** : By using the negative energy of trashes on the water surface ... Ok, of course, deep learning. 

We will compare two kind of methods :

- [Faster RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) : 2015 / The youngest from the RCNN gang / State-of-the art when he was younger
- [DETR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) : 2020 / [Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) : it's based on Transformers.

:abacus: Our dataset : TrashCan dataset. This dataset was introduced on 2020 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08097.pdf), and contains images from a submarine robot, with annotations for object detection and segmentation. We have chose to work on the 'instances' classes, that is to say on $22$ classes, including the robot that partly appears on many images, different trash categories, but also general categories of undersea fauna and flora.

# Organisation of this repository !

For each method (DETR or Faster RCNN), we create a folder containing two subfolders :

- Training : In the Training folder, there are all the notebooks used in order to train and evaluate each algorithm.
- Prediction : In the Prediction folder, There are only notebooks that provide functions in order to test our models on images.

# Some results !

:drum: :drum: :drum: In our report : still available.
